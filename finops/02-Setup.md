# Setup

Before fees can be generated, processed, or settled across the platform, the fee schedule parameters must be configured correctly. These settings control how transactions are posted, which journals are used for different payment types, how financial dimensions are applied, how pro rata adjustments behave, and how the system integrates with related modules. This setup is typically completed once during initial configuration and revisited when new functionality is enabled or organisational settings change.
